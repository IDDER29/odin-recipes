    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Tagoulla</em>, also known fondly as 'Aych', is more than just food for the Amazigh people; it is part of their cultural identity, heritage, and traditions. Native to the Souss-Massa region and beloved throughout the High Atlas, Anti-Atlas, and the Sous valley, <em>Tagoulla</em>'s unpretentious preparation and versatility of ingredients—being made with corn, barley, or wheat flour—make it a robust symbol of the diverse Moroccan cuisine.

        The utility and significance of <em>Tagoulla</em> cover immense ground—right from being a go-to meal for nomadic tribes to being served at special occasions. A noteworthy moment in the Amazigh calendar where this dish shines is the New Year celebrations, where the "<em>Tagoulla</em> of January" becomes a staple, bringing people together in joyous feasts.
