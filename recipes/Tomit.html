    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
        <em>Tomit</em>e, or Asida as it is also called, is a traditional dish that has been part of the Moroccan Amazigh culture for centuries. It is made from lightly roasted barley flour, water, sugar, honey, and argan oil, a local product that is extracted from the kernels of the argan tree. The dish has a brown color and a nutty flavor, and it can be served with various toppings, such as dates, nuts, dried fruits, or cheese.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <em>Tomit</em>e is not just an ordinary dish in the Amazigh community; it is a symbol of celebration and unity. It is often prepared during religious festivals like Mawlid and Eid, as well as during traditional ceremonies that mark important life events. <em>Tomit</em>e reflects the rich cultural heritage of the Amazigh people and their strong connection with their land and its traditions.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of Barley Flour</li>
        <li>4 cups of Hot Water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of Sugar</li>
        <li>Honey (to taste)</li>
        <li>Argan Oil (to taste)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>Following that, blend honey and argan oil into the mix; stir until it combines thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Once the mixture is adequately mixed, transfer it to a plate and shape it as per your preference.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Adjust the Sugar and Honey content to align with your taste.</li>
        <li>Employing different kinds of flours such as wheat or corn is an option, but they won't render the same color and flavor as barley would.</li>
        <li>The leftover <em>Tomit</em>e can be stored in an airtight container and refrigerated for up to three days. It can be reheated either via a microwave or steamed over boiling water.</li>
    </ul>
